# Prototype structure
## Prototype inside
Downloaded (or published to cloud) prototype consist of two parts:
- prototype images and data
- viewer code and resources

## External files
The downloaded prototype includes all required files, so it doesn't load any external resources or call any URLs.

## Cloud-based CSS and JS resources
If you don't need to work with prototype in offline mode and want to decrease a prototype size, then you can enable "Use cloud-based CSS and JS resources" settings. In this case a prototype will load "js" and "resources" folders from cloud.
