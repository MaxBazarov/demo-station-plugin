- prototype images and data
- viewer code and resources

# External files
The downloaded prototype includes all required files, so it doesn't load any external URLs

# Cloud-based CSS and JS resources
If you don't need to see your prototype in offline mode and want to decrease a prototype size, then you can enable "Use cloud-based CSS and JS resources" settings. In this case a protype will load "js" and "resources" folders from cloud.
